## What We're Building

Path Picker is a simple iPad game where people choose between two photos of walking paths. By seeing which paths people prefer, we learn what matters most to Casey residents when walking.

The game shows **scenario context** above each photo pair - an icon and temperature (e.g., 🌙 15° for nighttime, ☀️ 21° for a pleasant day). This tells participants what conditions to imagine when choosing.

**Why scenarios?** Lighting matters at night but not during the day. Shade is pleasant during the day but irrelevant at night. By separating scenarios, we get cleaner data.

**Why 21° for daytime?** At 21°, the weather is neutral - shade is pleasant but not essential. This removes heat bias and lets us see what people actually prefer about different paths (including factors like safety feel and aesthetics, not just shade).

## What We Need From You

**~18-20 photos of walking paths** from Casey (or visually similar areas), sourced primarily from Google Street View.

Photos are split into two sets:

### Set 1: Nighttime Scenario Photos (~10 photos)
For comparisons shown with 🌙 15° context. Focus on:
- **Lighting** (would it feel safe at night?)
- **Accessibility** (is the path smooth, wide, obstacle-free?)
- **Also tag**: Safety feel and aesthetic feel (see below)
- Shade/trees don't matter for these - it's dark anyway

### Set 2: Daytime Scenario Photos (~10 photos)  
For comparisons shown with ☀️ 21° context. Focus on:
- **Shade/tree cover** (is it exposed to sun or shaded?)
- **Accessibility** (is the path smooth, wide, obstacle-free?)
- **Also tag**: Safety feel and aesthetic feel (see below)
- Lighting doesn't matter for these - it's bright daylight anyway

## The Photo Matrices

We need two sets of photos. Use these as your collection checklists.

### Set 1: Nighttime Scenario Photos (🌙 15°)

These will be shown with a moon icon and 15° temperature. Participants imagine walking at night.

| # | Lighting | Accessibility | Safety Feel | Aesthetic Feel | What to look for |
|---|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| N1 | Good | Good | Safe | Good | Well-lit, smooth, open sightlines, well-maintained |
| N2 | Good | Good | Neutral | Neutral | Well-lit, smooth, typical suburban |
| N3 | Good | Poor | Safe | Neutral | Well-lit but rough path, not isolated |
| N4 | Good | Poor | Neutral | Poor | Well-lit but rough, less maintained |
| N5 | Moderate | Good | Safe | Good | Some lighting, smooth, welcoming |
| N6 | Moderate | Moderate | Neutral | Neutral | Typical suburban path, okay lighting |
| N7 | Poor | Good | Unsafe | Neutral | Dark/isolated but smooth - underpass |
| N8 | Poor | Good | Neutral | Good | Dark but maintained, near houses |
| N9 | Poor | Poor | Unsafe | Poor | Dark, rough, isolated - worst case |
| N10 | Moderate | Poor | Neutral | Neutral | Some lighting, rough path |

**For nighttime photos**: Focus on lighting and accessibility, but **also assess safety feel and aesthetic feel**. We want a mix - not all "safe" photos should have good lighting.

**Key insight**: A well-lit path can still feel unsafe (isolated underpass with lights). A dark path can feel safer (residential street with houses nearby). Capture this variety.

### Set 2: Daytime Scenario Photos (☀️ 21°)

These will be shown with a sun icon and 21° temperature (neutral/pleasant day). Participants imagine walking during the day.

| # | Shade | Accessibility | Safety Feel | Aesthetic Feel | What to look for |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| D1 | Good | Good | Safe | Good | Shady tree canopy, smooth, well-maintained |
| D2 | Good | Good | Neutral | Neutral | Shady, smooth, typical suburban |
| D3 | Good | Poor | Safe | Good | Shady but rough - natural trail, park setting |
| D4 | Good | Poor | Neutral | Poor | Shady but rough, overgrown |
| D5 | Moderate | Good | Safe | Good | Patchy shade, smooth, welcoming |
| D6 | Moderate | Moderate | Neutral | Neutral | Some trees, typical path |
| D7 | Poor | Good | Safe | Good | Exposed but smooth, near shops/houses |
| D8 | Poor | Good | Neutral | Neutral | Exposed, smooth, typical new estate |
| D9 | Poor | Poor | Unsafe | Poor | Exposed, rough, isolated - worst case |
| D10 | Moderate | Poor | Neutral | Neutral | Patchy shade, rough path |

**For daytime photos**: Focus on shade and accessibility, but **also assess safety feel and aesthetic feel**. We want a mix - not all "shady" photos should feel safe.

**Key insight**: A shady path can feel unsafe (isolated bush trail). An exposed path can feel safe (open area near shops). Capture this variety.

**Important**: Because we're using 21° (neutral temperature), we're not testing "would you avoid the sun?" We're testing broader preferences about path quality, safety, and feel.

**Tip**: You don't need perfect matches. Look for photos that clearly *read* as that combination at a glance.

## How to Identify Each Attribute

### Lighting (for Nighttime photos): Would this feel safe to walk at night?

| Level | What to look for in Street View |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| **Good** | Visible street lights, open sightlines, well-maintained residential streets, commercial areas with shopfronts |
| **Moderate** | Some street lights but spaced out, mixed visibility, typical suburban streets |
| **Poor** | Underpasses, tunnels, paths behind buildings, heavily shaded areas with no visible lighting, isolated paths away from streets |

**Note**: Even in daytime Street View, you can tell if a path would feel dark at night by looking for:
- Are street lights visible?
- Is it isolated or near houses/shops?
- Does it have overhead cover (underpass, dense trees blocking sky)?
- Would you feel comfortable walking here at 9pm?

---

### Shade (for Warm Day photos): Would this be comfortable on a warm day?

| Level | What to look for in Street View |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| **Good** | Mature tree canopy over path, shaded walkways, awnings or covered areas |
| **Moderate** | Some trees but patchy coverage, intermittent shade |
| **Poor** | Fully exposed path, no trees, wide open concrete/asphalt, car parks, paths along main roads with no vegetation |

---

### Accessibility (for ALL photos): Could someone with a pram or mobility aid use this easily?

| Level | What to look for in Street View |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| **Good** | Wide, smooth concrete or asphalt path, no obstacles, gentle grade, clear kerb ramps |
| **Moderate** | Decent surface but narrower, some minor cracks or uneven sections, typical footpath |
| **Poor** | Cracked/broken surface, very narrow, overgrown vegetation encroaching, missing kerb ramps, steps or steep grade, obstacles (poles, bins) blocking path |

Accessibility is relevant in both scenarios - it always matters whether the path is usable.

## Photo Requirements

### Technical Specs

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Minimum size | 1200px on the shortest side |
| Format | JPG or PNG |
| Orientation | TBD (we'll test on iPad) - capture in landscape for now |
| File naming | `night_01.jpg`, `night_02.jpg` for nighttime set; `hot_01.jpg`, `hot_02.jpg` for hot day set |

### Framing Guidelines

- **Perspective**: Looking down the path from a walker's viewpoint (eye-level)
- **Consistent angle**: Try to keep similar framing across all photos
- **Path as subject**: The path/footpath should be the main focus, not buildings or vehicles
- **Horizon position**: Roughly similar across photos

### What to Avoid

- Identifiable people or faces (blur or crop out if unavoidable)
- Prominent business names or signage
- Parked cars as main focus (some in background is fine)
- Unusual or distracting elements (construction, accidents, etc.)
- Very wide panoramic shots - focus on the path ahead

### Location Variety

Try to include a mix of:
- Residential streets
- Commercial/shopping areas
- Parks and reserves
- Near schools
- Different suburbs within Casey (Berwick, Cranbourne, Narre Warren, Clyde, etc.)

## Street View Tips

### Capturing Screenshots

1. Navigate to Casey in Google Maps, switch to Street View
2. Position the view looking down a path/footpath
3. Zoom to a natural walking perspective
4. Take a screenshot (avoid the Google UI elements if possible)
5. Crop to remove any visible Street View controls or watermarks

### Finding Good Examples

- Use the map to identify different area types (parks, residential, commercial)
- Footpaths along main roads often show different shade/exposure levels
- Look for parks with walking paths for good shade examples
- Underpasses and tunnels for "poor lighting" examples
- Older suburbs may have more accessibility issues (cracked paths)
- Newer estates often have better paths but less tree cover

## Photo Register (Google Sheet)

As you collect photos, log them in a Google Sheet. Note the different columns for each scenario:

### Nighttime photos (🌙 15°)

| filename | scenario | lighting | accessibility | safety_feel | aesthetic_feel | location_hint | notes |
|----------|----------|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| night_01.jpg | night | good | good | safe | good | Berwick commercial | Main street, visible lights |
| night_02.jpg | night | poor | good | unsafe | neutral | Narre Warren | Underpass, smooth path |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Daytime photos (☀️ 21°)

| filename | scenario | shade | accessibility | safety_feel | aesthetic_feel | location_hint | notes |
|----------|----------|-------|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| day_01.jpg | day | good | good | safe | good | Clyde park | Tree-lined path |
| day_02.jpg | day | poor | good | safe | neutral | Cranbourne | Exposed but near shops |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Column Definitions

**Use the words** `poor`, `moderate`, or `good` for lighting, accessibility, and shade.

**Scenario column**: Use `night` or `day` to indicate which set the photo belongs to.

**Safety and aesthetic feel** (new columns - important for analysis):

| Column | Values | What to assess |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| `safety_feel` | safe / neutral / unsafe | Would you feel safe here? (sightlines, isolation, "sketchy" feel, proximity to traffic) |
| `aesthetic_feel` | good / neutral / poor | General upkeep and welcoming appearance (graffiti, litter, overgrown vegetation, maintenance) |

**Why these matter**: People respond to more than just shade and accessibility - they also notice safety and aesthetics. By tagging these, we can analyse whether they're influencing choices more than our target attributes.

**Location hint**: Just a general description (suburb + type of area). We don't need exact addresses.

**Notes**: Anything else useful (e.g., "nice example of exposed path", "clearly dark underpass").

## Delivery

1. Collect ~20 photos total:
   - ~10 for nighttime set (`night_01.jpg`, `night_02.jpg`, etc.)
   - ~10 for daytime set (`day_01.jpg`, `day_02.jpg`, etc.)
2. Fill in the Google Sheet register (separate rows for each scenario)
3. Share the folder and sheet for review

**Timeline**: Aim to have a first batch ready by **week of Feb 17-23** so we can test on iPad and provide feedback before you finalize the full set.

---

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether a photo fits a category, grab it anyway and note your uncertainty in the sheet. We can review together and decide.

The most important thing is getting a good variety of photos that clearly *look* different from each other - people will be making snap judgments, so the attributes need to be visually obvious.

---

## Quick Reference: What Makes a "Good" Photo

A good photo for this game:
- **For nighttime set**: Clearly shows lighting quality + accessibility (ignore shade)
- **For warm day set**: Clearly shows shade/exposure + accessibility (ignore lighting)
- Looks like somewhere in Casey (suburban Melbourne)
- Has the path as the main subject
- Would prompt someone to think "I would/wouldn't want to walk here"
- Is visually distinct from the other photos in the set

A poor photo for this game:
- Attributes are ambiguous or hard to read
- Distracting elements pull focus from the path
- Too similar to another photo in the set
- Unusual or unrepresentative location

---

## Summary: What You're Collecting

| Set | Prefix | Focus On | Also Tag | Ignore |
|-----|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Nighttime (🌙 15°) | `night_` | Lighting + Accessibility | Safety feel, Aesthetic feel | Shade/trees |
| Daytime (☀️ 21°) | `day_` | Shade + Accessibility | Safety feel, Aesthetic feel | Lighting |

Total: ~20 photos (10 per set).

**Critical**: 
- Tag each photo for `safety_feel` and `aesthetic_feel`
- Include counter-intuitive combinations (shady + unsafe, exposed + safe, etc.)
- We need variety in safety/aesthetic feel to understand what's actually driving choices
