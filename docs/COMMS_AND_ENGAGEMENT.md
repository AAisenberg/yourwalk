## Participation Prompts and Microcopy

### General Principles

- **Non-alarmist**: Don't create fear about walking safety
- **Inclusive**: Welcome all users, regardless of mobility, age, or walking frequency
- **Clear value**: Explain what's in it for users
- **Easy action**: Make it simple to participate
- **Transparent**: Explain how contributions are used

### Key Messages

**For route planning**:
- "Plan walking routes that match your needs"
- "See lighting, accessibility, and climate information for any route"
- "Choose routes that work for you"

**For contributions**:
- "Your observations help improve route information for everyone"
- "Share what you know about walking conditions in your area"
- "Every contribution helps build a better walking network"

**For transparency**:
- "Data comes from community observations, Council records, and environmental sources"
- "We show confidence levels so you know how reliable the information is"
- "This tool shows conditions and perceptions, not safety guarantees"

### Microcopy Examples

**On map interface**:
- "Plan a route to see lighting, accessibility, and climate information"
- "Toggle layers to explore different aspects of walking conditions"
- "Your observations help improve this map"

**On submission forms**:
- "Share your observations to help others plan better routes"
- "Your contribution will appear on the map after review"
- "All observations are anonymous unless you create an account"

**On route results**:
- "Routes are scored based on lighting, accessibility, and climate conditions"
- "Scores reflect conditions and perceptions, not safety guarantees"
- "Click a route to see detailed breakdown"

**On confidence indicators**:
- "High confidence: Multiple reliable sources, recent data"
- "Medium confidence: Single source or limited coverage"
- "Low confidence: Limited data available, use with caution"

### Participation Prompts

**In-app prompts** (non-intrusive, dismissible):
- After viewing routes: "Did this help? Share your own observations to improve the map"
- After first route: "Your observations help others. Want to contribute?"
- Periodic: "Haven't contributed yet? It only takes a minute"

**Engagement materials**:
- "Every observation counts. Share what you know about walking in Casey"
- "Help build a better walking network. Contribute your observations"
- "Your local knowledge makes this tool better for everyone"

**Options under consideration**:
1. Post-submission moderation (all reviewed before appearing)
2. Automated validation with human review for flags

### Moderation Criteria

**Accept submissions that**:

- Are clearly spam or automated
- Are duplicates of existing observations
- Are outside pilot area
- Contain personal information about others
- Make unsubstantiated claims about safety or crime

### Sensitive Reports

**If submission contains sensitive information** (e.g., safety concerns, infrastructure issues):
- **Review carefully**: Ensure it's appropriate for public display
- **Consider context**: May need additional review or Council notification
- **Protect privacy**: Remove any personal information
- **Council notification**: If serious infrastructure or safety issue, notify Council (process TBD)

**Process for sensitive reports**: TBD (to be defined with Council)

### Appeal Process

**If submission is rejected**:
- User can contact support to appeal
- Review decision with moderation team
- Provide feedback to user about why it was rejected (if appropriate)
- Allow resubmission if issue is resolved

### Moderation Resources

- **Moderation team**: TBD (project team, Council staff, or volunteers)
